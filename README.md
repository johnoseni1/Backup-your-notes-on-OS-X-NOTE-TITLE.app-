Backup notes
==============
 Apple doesn't provide a convenient way to export notes from Notes.app, I wrote this AppleScript to make that possible and easier

Saves each note as `folder_name/note_title.html`, since HTML is the native format. 
Unicode titles work, but I'd adviece not to use path delimiters in titles to avoid problems (`:` and `/`)


Instructions
------------

1. Download the script
2. Edit the variable `rootPath`
3. Run!

You can export the script as an application using the AppleScript editor, 
and make it run with an hotkey, etc.
